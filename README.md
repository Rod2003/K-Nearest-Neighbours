# K-Nearest-Neighbours
This project was done as a contribution to a larger project in which the MNIST Dataset was used to train and test a proprietary ML-model to classify digits with an accuracy of over 98%.

The source code can be downloaded and tested in a notebook (originally made in Google Colab Notebook). Additional provided files are the following:
  1. mnist_test.csv
  2. mnist_train.csv

In order to successfully run the KNN program, these files must be imported into your notebook. 
*NOTE: the KNN program is able to test and train any dataset - for the purpose of this project however, I used the MNIST dataset.
